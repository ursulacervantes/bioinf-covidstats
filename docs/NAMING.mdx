*# Naming*

*## React components*

In most cases, components should live in their own file, named after said file.

***Don’t:***

```js
// components/Card/index.js
const AppCard = props => {
  // …
}

export default AppCard
```

***Do:***

```js
// components/Card/index.js
const Card = props => {
  // …
}

export default Card
```

React components wrapped with a Fela component should preserve their name, only
with the `Styled` prefix. This makes it clear which component is used, and that
their styles are complemented with a Fela component.

***Don’t:***

```js
const LogoWithPadding = createComponent(styles.logo, Logo)
```

***Do:***

```js
const StyledLogo = createComponent(styles.logo, Logo)
```

*## Fela rules*

Speaking of Fela, the rules should be named after the type of content they
style, never the styles themselves, and without a prefix as they are strictly
local.

***Don’t:***

```js
const Copy = createComponent(styles.blueBackground, 'p')
const ExploreCard = createComponent(styles.exploreCard, 'div')
```

***Do:***

```js
const Copy = createComponent(styles.copy, 'p')
const ExploreCard = createComponent(styles.card, 'div')
```

*## Helpers*

Helpers should be named after what their purpose and their name should start
with a verb.

***Don’t:***

```js
const aspectRatioDimensions = () => {}
```

***Do:***

```js
const getAspectRatioDimensions = () => {}
```

*## Booleans*

Booleans should be given names that formulate a question. This is commonly
achieved with prefixes such as “should”, “has”, or “is”.

***Don’t:***

```js
const renderCard = Boolean(props.card) && Boolean(props.balance)
const pendingTransactions = props.unconfirmedTransaction.length > 0
const webTeamMember = sailorsList.includes(member)
```

***Do:***

```js
const shouldRenderCard = Boolean(props.card) && Boolean(props.balance)
const hasPendingTransactions = props.unconfirmedTransaction.length > 0
const isWebTeamMember = sailorsList.includes(member)
```

*## GraphQL operations*

GraphQL operations should be named after what their purpose and their name
should start with a verb, just like helpers.

***Don’t:***

```
api/pies/symptoms
```

***Do:***

```
api/pies/getSymptoms
```
