*# GraphQL*

> GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those
> queries with existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable
> description of the data in the API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly
> what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and
> enables powerful developer tools.


*## Updating the API*

The GraphQL API lives in the `lamba/api` directory. It is divided into topics which
more or less map to the API surface from back-end and third parties. To update
the API layer, one needs to add a new operation and its associated resolver to
the schema.

For the sake of the explanation, let’s assume there is an API about cats with a
query to get a new cat, and a mutation to pet a cat. For instance:

```bash
cats/
├── getCat/
│   ├── index.js
│   └── resolver.js
└── petCat/
    ├── index.js
    └── resolver.js
```

*### Updating the schema*

The schema is a definition of the API. It defines the name of the query, its
arguments (if any), and how it should be resolved (see
[how to write a resolver](_#writing-the-resolver_)).

Considering an API to get a cat (`getCat`), the schema might look more or less
like this:

```js
import gql from 'graphql-tag'
import resolver from './resolver'

const query = `getCat: Cat`
const definition = gql`
  type Cat {
    id: ID
    color: String
    breed: String
    age: Int
  }
`

export default {
  query,
  resolver,
  types: definition,
}
```

The one for the mutation to pet the cat, like this:

```js
import resolver from './resolver'

const mutation = `petCat(name: String!): StatusAndErrors`

export default {
  mutation,
  resolver,
}
```

> ⚠️ These new schema additions need to be added to the schema definition
> (`src/lambda/schema.js`).

*### Writing the resolver*

A GraphQL resolver receives 3 arguments:

- `obj`: usually unused; in case of nested resolvers, this argument contains the
  parent object.
- `args`: the arguments for the query, as defined in the schema.
- `context`: the GraphQL context, containing the server `request` and
  `response`.

In its simplest form, a resolver fetching some data — such as the one to get a
cat — might look like this:

```js
import axios from 'axios'
import { API_BASE_URL } from 'constants/api'

export default async (obj, args, context) => {
  const endpoint = API_BASE_URL + '/api/cats'
  const response = await axios.get(endpoint)

  return response.data
}
```

*## Querying data*

Querying data usually looks like this:

```js
import { useQuery } from 'react-apollo'
import { loader } from 'graphql.macro';

const getCatQuery = loader('./query.graphql');

const Component = props => {
  const { data, loading, error } = useQuery(getCatQuery, {
    variables: { name: 'Meow' },
  })

  if (loading) {
    // Handle loading…
  }

  if (error) {
    // Handle possible network error…
  }

  // Do something with the data…
}
```

And the query file (`query.graphql`):

```graphql
query getCat($name: String) {
  # `cat: ` here means the data (`breed` and `color`) will be found at
  # `data.cat` instead of `data.getCat`.
  cat: getCat(name: $name) {
    breed
    color
  }
}
```

It is important that the component is resilient to the absence of data. When
rendered dynamically, the data gets fetched asynchronously which implies lack of
data while loading. There are multiple ways to handle this (displaying a loading
state, not rendering the component, displaying tombstones…), and so far the
approach depends on the component and its role.

In order to further decouple business logic from view concerns, one could decide
to handle the loading state and the data collection (picking and naming data for
the view) in the container itself rather than the component.
