*# Styling*

Our styling layer runs on [Fela](_https://fela.js.org_). Fela allows us to
write styles in a component-driven manner and generates critical CSS and atomic
classes for high performance. It’s also a thriving ecosystem of plugins and
libraries.

*## Architecture*

Components all have their own folder (PascalCase), no matter whether they need
styles or not. When they do, they have a `styles.js` file next to their
`index.js` file.

```
└── MyComponent/
    ├── index.js
    └── styles.js
```

This file is usually imported as `styles`.

```js
import styles from './styles'
```

The `styles.js` file exports a
[`StyleSheet`](_https://github.com/rofrischmann/fela/blob/master/packages/fela-tools/docs/StyleSheet.md_)
(from `fela-tools`) which makes sure to wrap all JavaScript objects with a
function to become proper Fela rules.

```js
import { StyleSheet } from 'fela-tools'

const base = {
  display: 'flex',
}

export default StyleSheet.create({
  base,
})
```

*## Syntax*

*### Units*

- ***Lengths:***
  - Sizes are usually expressed relative to the font size (`em`).
  - Font sizes (`font-size`) are expressed in percentiles of the current size
    (`%`).
  - Font-size-agnostic sizes are expressed in root-em (`rem`).
  - Single-pixel sizes are expressed in pixels (`1px`).
  - Viewport-related sizes are expressed in viewport fractions (`vw`, `vh`).
  - Sizes relative to a number of characters are expressed in characters (`ch`).
  - Line heights (`line-height`) are expressed without unit.
  - Zero-values are expressed without unit.
- ***Angles:*** Angles are expressed in degrees (`deg`) or alternatively in turns
  (`turn`).
- ***Durations:*** [Durations](_#durations_) are expressed in milliseconds (`ms`),
  even when null (`0ms`).

*### Media queries*

Media queries are authored as nested objects with the media query string as a
key.

```js
const foo = {
  '@media (min-width: 1337px)': {
    width: '50%',
  },
}
```

Most breakpoints are shared across projects and can be found in
`styles/variables`. Some are project specific and live in the project’s
variables.

```js
import { SMALL_SCREEN } from 'styles/variables'

const foo = {
  [SMALL_SCREEN]: {
    width: '10%',
  },
}
```

*### Shorthands*

Fela converts all declarations into single-purpose CSS classes (also known as
“atomic classes”). For maximum reusability, shorthand properties should be
divided into their individual components.

Properties for which the value follows a specific pattern or order are
automatically split on the Fela layer. These are: `padding`, `margin`, `flex`,
`border`, `borderStyle`, `borderColor`, `borderWidth` and `outline`.

All the other non-deterministic shorthands (that is, properties for which the
value follows no particular order, such as `transition`) need to be split by
hand.

> ⚠️ The breaking down of shorthands can occasionally have unexpected results.
> For example, `outline: 0` results in `outline-width: 0;` whereas
> `outline: 'none'` results in `outline-style: none;`. In Safari, the former has
> no effect on non-focusable elements (elements made focusable with `tabindex`),
> while the latter results in what the author intended: to hide the outlines.
> For this reason, make sure to check styles in other browsers and opt for
> declarations that work universally.

```js
// 1. The `margin` property is divided into its directional sub-properties
//    automatically.
// 2. The `border` property is divided into its directional sub-properties
//    automatically.
// 3. The `transition` property cannot be easily split, even with a helper,
//    therefore needs to be divided manually at authoring time.
const foo = {
  margin: '1em auto' /* 1 */,
  border: '1px solid silver' /* 2 */,
  transitionProperty: 'opacity' /* 3 */,
  transitionDuration: '250ms' /* 3 */,
}
```

*### Conditional styling*

One of the interesting benefits of using Fela is that we have access to
components props in rules. This makes it possible to perform dynamic styling
based on the state of the application.

```js
const foo = props => ({
  height: props.collapsed ? 0 : '100%',
  opacity: props.disabled ? 0.5 : undefined,
})
```

> ℹ️ Any value resolving to `undefined` will be discarded by the Fela renderer.

When multiple properties have their value based on a property, we can spred an
object like so:

```js
const foo = props => ({
  color: 'red',

  ...(props.disabled
    ? {
        opacity: 0,
        visibility: 'hidden',
        pointerEvents: 'none',
      }
    : {}),
})
```

> ⚠️ It is important to use a ternary instead of a conditional expression (e.g.
> `...(disabled && { … })`) as it could end up trying to spread `false` (after
> Babel compilation), which would cause issues on old Android devices.

*## How to style*

*### DOM elements*

To style DOM elements, wrap them with the
[`createComponent`](_http://fela.js.org/docs/guides/UsageWithReact.html_) function
from `react-fela` (or `createComponentWithProxy` when wanting to pass all props
through). This function expects a
[Fela rule](_http://fela.js.org/docs/basics/Rules.html#_) and an element name.

```js
const Wrapper = createComponent(styles.myRule, 'div')
```

By default `createComponent` only passes the following props to the underlying
element: `className`, `id` and `style`. Anything else gets omitted. To force the
passing down of props, you can pass an array of prop names as the 3rd argument.

```js
const Wrapper = createComponent(styles.myRule, 'div', ['aria-hidden'])
```

*### React components*

Styling React components is slightly more tricky, because it usually implies
several layers of styling which needs to be combined in the correct order.

The rule of thumb is that components should be exported with
[`createComponent`](_https://fela.js.org/docs/api/bindings/createComponent.html_)
or
[`createComponentWithProxy`](_https://fela.js.org/docs/api/bindings/createComponentWithProxy.html_)
so their styles can be extended with the `extend` prop. For instance:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { createComponentWithProxy } from 'react-fela'
import styles from './styles'

const Title = props => <h1 className={props.className}>{props.children}</h1>

export default createComponentWithProxy(styles, Title)
```

When using this component without intention of overwriting its styles, it can be
used normally. If its styles need to be customised however, it needs to receive
the rule as `extend` prop.

```jsx
import Title from '@components/Title'
import styles from './styles'

const CustomTitle = props => (
  <Title extend={styles.title}>{props.children}</Title>
)
```

When doing so, Fela will combine rules in the correct precedence order before
resolving them into class names and passing them down to the final `className`
prop. This is important as it makes sure not to have conflicting declarations
whose order is non-deterministic.

*#### About Fela proxies*

There are two ways to create “Fela components”: `createComponent` and
`createComponentWithProxy`. Both basically do the same thing with one
difference:

A component created with `createComponent` will pass no props down to the
underlying DOM element or React component (whatever is provided as a 2nd
argument) to the exception of `id` (for some reason) and `className` (since
that’s the entire point of the Fela component), as well as the ones passed as a
3rd argument.

In the following example, the `id` prop is passed to the underlying `div` DOM
element (by default), as well as the `aria-hidden` prop (as it is included in
the 3rd argument), but not the `isActive` prop.

```js
const Component = createComponent(() => ({ color: 'red' }), 'div', [
  'aria-hidden',
])

const tree = <Component id='foo' isActive aria-hidden />
```

A component created with `createComponentWithProxy` will pass all props down to
the underlying DOM element or React component (whatever is provided as a 2nd
argument) to the exception of the ones that are used in the styling rules.

In the following example, the `id` prop is passed to the underlying `div` DOM
element (by default), as well as the `aria-hidden` prop (since it is a proxy),
but not the `isActive` prop (as it is used in the rule).

```js
const Component = createComponentWithProxy(
  props => ({
    color: 'red',
    backgroundColor: props.isActive ? 'grey' : undefined,
  }),
  'div'
)

const tree = <Component id='foo' isActive aria-hidden />
```

*#### Example*

As an example, let’s consider the following component:

```js
const Component = createComponentWithProxy(() => ({ color: 'red' }), 'div')
```

Now, let’s imagine that we want to override this declaration to make the color
blue. The previous explanation tells us to do:

```js
<Component extend={() => ({ color: 'blue' })} />
```

In the current state of affairs, because `Component` is a Fela component (proxy
in this case, but it doesn’t have to), when extending it with the `extend` prop,
Fela will give the new styles precedence. Thus, our `color: 'blue'` declaration
will be used, and the `color: 'red'` one will not be applied at all.

Now let’s imagine `Component` was in fact written like this:

```js
import { RendererContext } from 'react-fela'

const Component = props => {
  const renderer = React.useContext(RendererContext)
  const className = renderer.renderRule(() => ({ color: 'red' }))

  return <div {...props} className={className} />
}

export default Component
```

What’s going to happen is that Fela will resolve both styling layers (the one
from `Component` and the one passed to it) independently, therefore applying
both `color: 'blue'` /_and_/ `color: 'red'`.

At this stage, it is not possible to know which color the text will actually be
since HTML class order is non-deterministic, resulting in the latest one defined
in the stylesheet being the one used.

That’s why it is important to export a Fela proxy for reusable components so
their styles can be safely and predictably overwritten by Fela.

*## Commenting*

CSS is a tricky language, full of hacks and oddities. Because of this, anything
that is not obvious at first glance should be commented.

Comments should respect the following rules:

- It should follow an empty line.
- It should use single line comments (`//`).
- It should precede the closest block (top-level or nested).
- When commenting a specific line, it should be annotated with a number and
  referenced in the explanation.
- Annotations longer than 80 characters should wrap to the next line while
  preserving the number indentation.

Refer to the following example as a go-to guide:

```js
// This comment explains some oddities from the following rule. It wraps at 80
// characters. This part can be skipped if unnecessary. Annotations are usually
// the relevant comments.
// 1. This is an annotation. It explains something specific about one line of
//    code. It wraps after 80 characters and preserves the indentation with the
//    number.
const rule = {
  marginBottom: '1em',
  overflow: 'hidden' /* 1 */,
}
```
